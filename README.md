# Hi, I'm Garghi Seenevas 👋

Engineer with a Master's in Engineering Acoustics from DTU, now building AI-powered applications. My background in signal processing, data pipelines, and structured experimentation gives me a unique angle on AI engineering — I don't just use the tools, I understand the signals behind them.

### 🚀 What I'm Building

- **[Ask My Thesis](link)** — A RAG chatbot that answers questions about neurophysiological responses to distractors, built with LangChain, ChromaDB & Groq *(coming soon)*
- More projects on the way — posture monitoring with AI agents, acoustic analysis tools, and more
